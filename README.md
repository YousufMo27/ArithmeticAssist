# ArithmeticAssist


## Description
Arithmetic is a website made with React with the sole purpose of providing help to others.
The website contains various topics from the Ontario High School curriculum with explanations
of each topic. Alongside these explanations, online videos from different creators are also 
linked to help clear any misunderstandings. This website was a passion project for me because
in High School I struggled with Math a lot, and I want to prevent others from making the same 
mistakes as me.

## Prerequisites

## Further improvements
